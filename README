===Archimedes
Archimedes is a rewrite of LibHaskell. LibHaskell is wonderful, but it does the following weird things:

 -Redefines Prelude functions under a different name
 -Has poorly defined functions in LibLists
 -Has no separation in LibLists, making it > 300 lines

Archimedes is designed to not only redefine LibHaskell, but to re-engineer it from the ground up. Archimedes is portable, non-bloated, and sanely separated.
